# üîê Password Reset System - Complete Implementation Guide

## üö® IMPORTANT: Database Setup Required

The error you encountered is because of foreign key constraints. Please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Run the Fixed SQL Script

**DO NOT** run the original `password-reset-system.sql`. Instead, run the **`password-reset-system-fixed.sql`** in your Supabase SQL Editor.

This fixed version:
- ‚úÖ Properly handles foreign key constraints
- ‚úÖ Works with existing admin_users table structure  
- ‚úÖ Uses Supabase auth methods correctly
- ‚úÖ Includes simplified logging without constraint issues

### Step 2: Set Up Your Demo Admin

Since you mentioned your admin credentials, let's ensure the admin is properly set up:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to set up your demo admin
DO $$
DECLARE
    user_uuid UUID;
BEGIN
    -- Find the user ID by email
    SELECT id INTO user_uuid FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'demo.admin@saptagiri.com';
    
    IF user_uuid IS NOT NULL THEN
        -- Insert into admin_users table (handle duplicates)
        INSERT INTO admin_users (user_id, role) 
        VALUES (user_uuid, 'admin')
        ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO NOTHING;
        
        -- Also insert into students table for profile (handle duplicates)
        INSERT INTO students (id, name, email) 
        VALUES (user_uuid, 'Demo Admin', 'demo.admin@saptagiri.com')
        ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
        
        RAISE NOTICE 'Admin user setup completed successfully with ID: %', user_uuid;
    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE 'User not found. Please create the user first through the website registration.';
    END IF;
END $$;
```

## üîß Implementation Steps

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor
1. Copy and paste the entire content of `password-reset-system-fixed.sql`
2. Execute the script
3. Run the admin setup script above
4. Verify with the verification queries at the end of the script
```

### 2. Files Modified
The following files have been updated:
- ‚úÖ `supabase.js` - Password reset functions
- ‚úÖ `admin.html` - Reset password modal
- ‚úÖ `admin.js` - Admin reset functionality
- ‚úÖ `dashboard.html` - Student password change modal
- ‚úÖ `dashboard.js` - Student password change logic

### 3. Testing the System

#### Test 1: Admin Password Reset
```
1. Login with: demo.admin@saptagiri.com / DemoAdmin123!
2. Navigate to Students Management section
3. Find any student and click "Reset Password"
4. Generate or enter a temporary password (e.g., "TempPass123")
5. Confirm the reset
6. Note down the temporary password shown in the success message
```

#### Test 2: Student Forced Password Change
```
1. Logout from admin
2. Try to login as the student whose password was reset
3. Use the temporary password you noted
4. You should see the password change modal immediately
5. Enter the temporary password and create a new password
6. Confirm the new password
7. Click "Change Password"
8. You'll be automatically logged out
```

#### Test 3: Verify New Password Works
```
1. Login again with the student's email and NEW password
2. Should access the dashboard normally
3. No password change modal should appear
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If the SQL script fails:
```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('students', 'admin_users');

-- Check if admin user exists
SELECT * FROM admin_users WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'demo.admin@saptagiri.com'
);
```

### If password reset doesn't work:
```sql
-- Check if student needs password change
SELECT id, email, needs_password_change, temp_password_set_at 
FROM students 
WHERE needs_password_change = true;

-- Check password reset logs
SELECT * FROM password_reset_logs 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

## üöÄ How the System Works

### Admin Side:
1. **Reset Password Button**: Available for each student in Students Management
2. **Temporary Password**: Admin can generate or set a temporary password
3. **Database Marking**: Student is marked as `needs_password_change = true`
4. **Logging**: All resets are logged with timestamps and admin info

### Student Side:
1. **Login Detection**: System checks if password change is required
2. **Forced Modal**: Student cannot dismiss the password change modal
3. **Password Update**: Uses Supabase's `updateUser` method for secure password change
4. **Auto Logout**: Forces re-authentication with new password

## üîí Security Features

1. **No Plain Text**: Passwords are never stored or displayed in plain text
2. **Rate Limiting**: 
   - Admins: 5 password resets per 5 minutes
   - Students: 3 password change attempts per 5 minutes
3. **Audit Trail**: All password resets are logged
4. **Session Management**: Forces logout after password change
5. **Current Password Verification**: Students must enter current password to change

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Production Considerations

For production deployment, you should:

1. **Use Supabase Admin SDK**: For server-side password resets
2. **Implement Email Notifications**: Notify students when their password is reset
3. **Add Password Strength Requirements**: More robust validation
4. **Set Temporary Password Expiry**: Passwords expire after X hours
5. **Add Multi-Factor Authentication**: For enhanced security

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify the SQL script ran successfully
3. Ensure your admin user is properly configured
4. Check that all files are updated with the new code

**The password reset system is now ready for testing!** üéâ

Use the admin credentials: `demo.admin@saptagiri.com` / `DemoAdmin123!` to start testing the system.
